# AI-Driven Blood Donation Network

## Overview

A decentralized system designed to coordinate blood availability across multiple facilities during emergencies. The network leverages Fetch.ai uAgents for autonomous decision-making and real-time communication, enabling quick response to urgent blood needs. This system ensures efficient communication and coordination among hospitals, blood banks, and patients through secure agent-based messaging.

## Agent Architecture

### 1. Patient Agent
- Handles patient registration and authentication
- Manages blood request submissions
- Receives and processes status updates
- Maintains request history

### 2. Hospital Agent
- Processes incoming blood requests
- Manages local blood inventory
- Coordinates with blood banks
- Handles emergency situations

### 3. Blood Bank Agent
- Maintains inventory records
- Processes supply requests
- Updates availability status
- Manages distribution logistics

### 4. Coordinator Agent
- Matches requests with available resources
- Manages emergency broadcasts
- Coordinates multi-facility operations
- Monitors system health

## Communication Patterns

### 1. Request Flow
- Patient submits request through frontend
- Patient Agent validates and forwards request
- Hospital Agent processes and matches inventory
- Coordinator Agent manages facility coordination

### 2. Inventory Updates
- Blood banks update inventory status
- Updates broadcast to network
- Hospitals receive real-time updates
- System adjusts availability matching

### 3. Emergency Protocol
- Urgent requests flagged for priority
- Immediate broadcast to all facilities
- Real-time coordination of resources
- Status updates to all stakeholders

### 4. Notification System
- Real-time status updates
- Emergency alerts
- Inventory level notifications
- Request fulfillment updates
